# IsCyclic Project

This project determines if a given graph (text file) is connected and also if it contains a cycle. It takes the name of a text file containing the input graph, and tells users whether the graph is connected and whether there is a cycle. 

# How-To-Run

The main method is stored in the AbstractGraph.java file. To run, click the run button in whatever IDE you are using. 

# Sample Runs: 
Program output: 
Enter the name of the input file

User input: 
bipartite.txt

Program output: 

The graph is connected
There is a cycle in the graph

Program output: 
Enter the name of the input file

User input: 
GraphVertices.txt

Program output: 


The graph is connected
There is a cycle in the graph
